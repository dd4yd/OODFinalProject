## Inheritance/ Extension in Java & Swift

### Java

In Java, inhertiance is the simple, yet powerful notion of creating a new class, although there is already a class that has some reusable code you wany, so you can derive the new class from the existing class. And in turn, you can resuse fields and methods of existing classes, making your code simpler and more powerful. A subclass can be of the superclass type, or of its more specific type.

public class MountainBike extends Bike {

	// class MountainBike is a subclass of Bike, of which can be casted as either type, along  
	// with adopting all of Bike class's methods and fields 
	
}


### Swift 

In Swift, inhertiance truly accomplishes/ hold true the same ideas as Java. The only difference is the syntax behing inheriting 

class MountainBike: Bike {

	//MountainBike is a subclass (inheriting) from bike
	
}
