# Interfaces / Protocols

## Java
1. What does the language support?
  * In Java they are called Interfaces
2. What abilities does it have?
  * Java uses interfaces to define methods needed to implement a class
  * Interfaces can only declare one method in order to pass methods
  * A class can implement more than one interface
3. How is it used?
  * Classes use interfaces by using the implements keyword
  *  ```Java
        class Director implements Person, Employee { }  ```
  * Lambda expressions are used to pass methods
  * ```Java
    StateOwner stateOwner = new StateOwner();

    stateOwner.addStateListener(
      (oldState, newState) -> System.out.println("State changed")
    );```

## Swift
1. What does the language support?
  * In Swift they are called Protocols
2. What abilities does it have?
  * Swift uses protocols to define properties as well as functions
  * A class can adopt more than one protocol
3. How is it used?
  * Classes do not use a keyword to adopt a protocol
  * ```Swift
  class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol { }```
