## Why was each language created?

Java: Java was originally created in the early 90's for interactive television, although it was too advanced for its time, so it pivoted towarard becoming a programming language with C/C++ like syntax that developers would find pleasing. When java was first released for the public in 1995, its platform promised a no cost, WORA (write once, run anywhere) platform.

Swift: Swift was ultimately created to replace the somewhat outdated Apple programming language Objective-C. It works with Apple's Cocoa Touch frameworks in order to service software towards every kind of Apple device (iOS, macOS, tvOS, Linux and watchOS). It embodies a lot of Objective-C ideas, and uses its runtime library which allows C/C++ and Objective C to be run within Swift programs. It's ultimately a safer and more flexible version of Objective-C

## What problems did the language try to address?

Java: As stated above, Java was originally created to enhance interactive television, althought it was ahead of the digital cable industry. This is what made it pivot towards Object Oriented Programming, promising developers a WORA platform. Over time, Java became the programming standard for object oriented design. A few problems/ goals the language tried to prioritize where simpleness, robust/ secureness, arhictectural neutral, high performance, threaded, and dynamic

Swift: The main idea the Apple was trying to address with the creation/ adaption of Swift, was that there were so many different lamnguages out that that all specialized in different aspects of software design. Apple wanted to culminate ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, and C# all into one concise paradigm. 

## Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

Java: Java wasn't really a reaction, but rather a replacement, creating a whole new paradigm for programming. They wanted to mimic C/C++'s easy to read/ comprehend syntax that developers would find farmiliar, although with the idea of object oriented design, and write once, run anywhere platform. 

Swift: In my mind, Swift was both a reaction and a replacement for other programming languages like Java and Objective C. Apple noticed a that Java had some glaring flaws in it, along with the fact the Objective-C wasn't doing as much as it should/ could have been; so they culminated the concepts from 5 or 6 other languages (stated above), in order to some sense create a master, multi paradigm programming language
